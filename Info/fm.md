In addition, network data appears in several application areas such as chemistry and genealogy. 

There are many formats for describing molecular graphs: Molfile, SDF, CML, PDB, XYZ, CIF, FASTA, CDX, CDXML, JCAMP-DX, SMILES, InChI, and others. 

The most widely used format for genealogical data exchange, GEDCOM is a plain text file format that stores information about individuals, families, events, and sources. It has several derivatives. It is considered an exchange format between various genealogy programs, which are often based on their own format. Some of the most well-known programs are Ancestry Tree Files, Family Tree Maker, Legacy Family Tree, RootsMagic, OpenGen Alliance, Open Archives Format, FamilySearch JSON, Gramps XML, TEI, PROGEN, Webtrees, and PAF.
